## Last Week's Accomplishments

This week I helped the Observatory team through some of their assigned issues. However, most of my time was spent on the large group presentation for Observatory. This week I assembled the slides and left notes on each slide for each developer to use for the presentation. In small group we did a dry run of the presentation and all went well. We made some minor adjustments and are now ready for Friday.

## This Week's Plan

This week, I plan to review the slides and make sure I am prepared for the large group presentation. In my last update, I discussed updating the attendance page. However, this week I would like to wrap up the URP form automation feature.

## Anything Blocking?

Trying to figure out how to host the URP form images on the back end.

## Notes

No other notes at this time.
