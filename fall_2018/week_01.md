## Last Week's Accomplishments

This past week I was focused on getting the new Observatory devs up and running,
and I also began discussing VueJS with them. This process entailed getting
people's environments setup (node, npm, docker, etc.).

## This Week's Plan

This week I am planning on meeting with Alex to create some issues on GitHub,
and will distribute the issues amongst the team members. I will also be trying
to ensure that there is plenty of low-hanging fruit for the team members new to
VueJS to pick up so that they can easily transition into JavaScript development.

## Anything Blocking?

Since the Observatory leadership is being passed down to me from Alex, I need to
understand where Alex left off with Observatory's development. So, getting that
understanding is my/my team's main blocker right now.

## Notes

No other notes at this time.
