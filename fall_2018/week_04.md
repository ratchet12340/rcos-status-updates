## Last Week's Accomplishments

This week I created some new issues for the development team. I am having some of the members work on the UserRegistration model/routes so that I can continue working with the automated URP form work. I also continued my focus on trying to wrap up the VueJS rewrite.

Specifically, I worked on attendance code submission, since it was currently a static page. Now, however, you can submit attendance codes to the back-end, and have it store a user's attendance.


## This Week's Plan

This week, I plan to help finish integrating the new UserRegistration model/routes, and use them on the front-end to wrap up URP form automation. I also have some cleanup to do for attendance code submission.

## Anything Blocking?

Nothing this week.
