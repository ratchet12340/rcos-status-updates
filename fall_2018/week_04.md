## Last Week's Accomplishments

This week I assigned the Observatory dev team some more issues. These issues entailed making more models, routes, and controllers for the Team model. I helped walk them through creating their own issues, referred them to pre-existing code, and opening pull requests on their own. Hopefully this translates to increased productivity as they can now go through the work flow without additional help.

As for my own work, I have been working on the front-end components for implementing automated URP forms. I have used some of Alex's rcos-forms source
to implement it, and I created a VueX store to go along with it. I still need to implement some conditional rendering based on whether a user has completed their
URP form, and I also need to implement a coordinator view of the URP forms. However, this will come after I do some back-end work for saving a user's URP form to
file. Luckily, the framework for this has been set up by the dev team in the earlier weeks.

This week I created some new issues for the development team. I am having some of the members work on the UserRegistration model/routes so that I can continue working with the automated URP form work. I also continued my focus on trying to wrap up the VueJS rewrite.

Specifically, I worked on attendance code submission, since it was currently a static page. Now, however, you can submit attendance codes to the back-end, and have it store a user's attendance.


## This Week's Plan

This week, I plan to help finish integrating the new UserRegistration model/routes, and use them on the front-end to wrap up URP form automation. I also have some cleanup to do for attendance code submission.

## Anything Blocking?

Nothing this week.
