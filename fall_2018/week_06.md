## Last Week's Accomplishments

This week I learned about how to send images over the wire (using blobs) in JavaScript. Almost had URP form image saving done, but it is still incomplete. I might plan to finish it up over break since it is close, and can open a PR to finally finish this feature.

The Observatory team also presented in large group this past week. They did a great job.

I helped the Observatory devs finish up their last issues, too.

## This Week's Plan

Given this is the end of the semester, no work will be planned for a bit. But as I mentioned above, I would like to finish implementing saving URP images.

## Anything Blocking?

Nothing blocking.

## Notes

No other notes at this time.
