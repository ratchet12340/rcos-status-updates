## Last Week's Accomplishments

This week I assigned the Observatory dev team their first issues. This also entailed helping each member
individually through their questions, explaining the existing code that they were working around,
and describing some features of JavaScript (promises, exporting, etc.)

I myself have been working on implementing the Multer library for file uploading. This feature will help in saving URP forms to
disk, which helps with automating the URP form process.


## This Week's Plan

This week I will hopefully finish implementing the Multer library, assign new tickets to my team (as I helped them finish their tickets
this week), and meet with Alex to clear up my questions.

## Anything Blocking?

As mentioned last week, Alex has been the driving force for Observatory development in the past, and I have questions
on how we should be rewriting the backend (Alex has discussed with me restructuring the backend, and eventually the frontend to make Observatory
more of a tool for the RCOS coordinators). I plan to talk with him on Slack this week.

## Notes
